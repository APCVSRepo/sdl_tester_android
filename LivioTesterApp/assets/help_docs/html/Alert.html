The Alert command allows developers to display a pop-up alert object on the head-unit UI.  The alert command has the ability to display 3 lines of text as well as speak a message to the driver.  Alerts are also able to play an alert sound as the pop-up appears.

<p>
To create an alert on the head-unit, the following inputs are available:

<p>
<h2>Alert Lines 1-3 (at least 1 required)</h2>
<h3>Type: String</h3>
<h4>Max length: 500</h4>
</br>
Alert messages are permitted to have up to 3 lines of text to alert the user.  Alert messages should be concise and relevant to what the user is doing.

<p>
<h2>Text to Speak (optional)</h2>
<h3>Type: List&#60;TTSChunk&#62;</h3>
<h4>Min array length: 1</h4>
<h4>Max array length: 100</h4>
</br>
The text to speak for an alert message will be spoken to the driver by the vehicle's text to speech engine.  This text should be a concise message telling the user what the alert is about. 

<p>
<h2>Alert Sound Enable (optional)</h2>
<h3>Type: Boolean</h3>
</br>
If your alert desires the vehicle's speakers to play an alert sound, set this value to true.  If this value is omitted, it will be set to false.

<p>
<h2>Alert Duration (optional)</h2>
<h3>Type: Integer</h3>
<h4>Min value: 3000 (ms)</h4>
<h4>Max value: 10000 (ms)</h4>
<h4>Default value: 5000 (ms)</h4>
</br>
This value represents how long the alert should be displayed to the user.  The duration parameter is an integer representing how many milliseconds the alert should be displayed for.
If this value is omitted, timeout will be set to 5 seconds.

<p>
<h2>Progress Indicator (optional)</h2>
<h3>Type: Boolean</h3>
</br>
If supported on the given platform, the alert GUI will include some sort of animation indicating that loading of a feature is progressing.  e.g. a spinning wheel or hourglass, etc.
If this value is omitted, it will be set to false.

<p>
<h2>Soft Buttons (optional)</h2>
<h3>Type: List&#60;Soft Buttons&#62;</h3>
</br>
A list of software buttons to be displayed in a list alongside the alert dialog.  If the head-unit doesn't support soft buttons, this value is ignored.
