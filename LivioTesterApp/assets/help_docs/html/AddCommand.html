<div class="page-header"><h1>Add Command</h1></div>

The AddCommand command allows developers to add a command object into the head-unit's main menu.  When the item on the head-unit is clicked, 
the click event is dispatched through the onOnCommand callback in the SDLService.  From there, it can be dispatched to the appropriate click-listener 
based on the clicked item's ID.

<p>
<b>Either menu parameters or VR commands must be included or the message will be rejected.</b>

<p>
There are 4 available settings to create a command in the head-unit's main menu:

<p>
<h2>Command ID (required)</h2>
<h3>Type: ID (integer)</h3>
<h4>Min value: 0</h4>
<h4>Max value: 2,000,000,000</h4>
</br>
The command ID represents a unique ID of the command in the menu.  When this command is clicked, a callback to onOnCommand() will be issued
with an ID of the button that was clicked.  This ID should be used to dispatch click events to the correct handler.  

<p>
<h2>Menu Parameters (optional)</h2>
<h3>Type: MenuParams</h3>
</br>
The menu parameters tell the system about where this command will be located in the menu and how to display it.  
<b>If menu parameters are omitted, VR commands are required.</b>

<p>
Menu parameters include the ID of the command's parent menu,
the position of the command in the list and a command name, representing the text to display within the body of the command on the head-unit's main menu.

<h3>Command Name</h3>
The command's name represents the text to show in the menu item.

<h3>Parent ID</h3>
<h4>Min value: 0</h4>
<h4>Max value: 2,000,000,000</h4>
The command's parent ID represents which SubMenu, if applicable, this command should be added to.  Commands can be added to the root-level of the head-unit's main menu, 
or, if a submenu has been added to the head-unit's main menu, 
commands can be added into the submenu as well.  For more information, see <a href="AddSubmenu.html">AddSubmenu</a>.

<p>
If the command is a top-level command, parent ID should be omitted.

<h3>Position</h3>
<h4>Min value: 0</h4>
<h4>Max value: 1,000</h4>
The command's position represents it's location in the head-unit's menu list.  If the command should be added to the end of the list, position should be omitted.

<p>
<h2>Voice Recognition Keyword(s) (optional)</h2>
<h3>Type: List<String></h3>
<h4>Min array size: 1</h4>
<h4>Max array size: 100</h4>
<h4>Max string length (per string): 99</h4>
</br>
The voice recognition keyword input tells the vehicle what keywords are linked to this particular command when spoken through the vehicle's voice system.  If this parameter
is provided, it cannot be empty or null.

<p>
<b>If VR commands are omitted, menu parameters are required.</b>

<p>
<h2>Image (optional)</h2>
<h3>Type: Image</h3>
</br>
The image for a particular command represents an image to be displayed alongside the command name within the body of this command on the head-unit's main menu.  Images must have been added 
to the system through the <a href="PutFile.html">PutFile</a> command before they can be referenced for an AddCommand.

<p>
If the Image parameter is omitted, either a placeholder image will be displayed, or only the command name will be displayed.
