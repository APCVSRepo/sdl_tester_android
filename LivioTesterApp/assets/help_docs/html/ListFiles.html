The ListFiles command allows developers to read a list of files that have been added to the head-unit through SDL.  This command shows any dynamic files that have been
added through the <a href="PutFile.html">PutFile</a> command as well as any static images that are permanently stored on the head-unit.

<p>
The ListFiles command does not accept any parameters.
